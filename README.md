# üéÆ **Heatmap-Visualization for PUBG Player Deaths**

**Description**

This repository contains two death heatmaps created using **Tableau** to visualize the locations where players commonly die on the **PUBG** game maps. These heatmaps are generated from data collected from in-game matches and help identify hotspots of player deaths, providing valuable insights for game analysis and strategy.

- **Gradient (from high to low death rate)**:  
  **Red ‚Üí Orange ‚Üí Yellow ‚Üí Green ‚Üí White**
  - **Red**: High death rate (most deaths)
  - **Orange ‚Üí Yellow ‚Üí Green**: Medium to low death rate (moderate deaths)
  - **White**: No deaths recorded

### **Game Description** _from Kaggle_

**PUBG** (PlayerUnknown‚Äôs Battlegrounds) is a **first/third-person shooter** battle royale game. It drops over **90 players** onto a large island where teams and solo players fight to be the last one remaining. The objective is to scavenge weapons, armor, and supplies while avoiding a continually shrinking "bluezone," which damages players outside the safe zone. Players can either choose to fight or hide in the quest to survive and be the last player standing.

### **Reasoning Behind the Heatmap**

The **death heatmaps** are created to identify **player tendencies** and potential issues within the game. By analyzing where most player deaths occur, game developers and players can:

- Spot frequent hotspots where deaths occur.
- Understand player behaviors and decisions.
- Enhance gameplay experience and increase retention rate.

### **Methodology**

1. **Data Source**:
   - **Link**: [PUBG Match Deaths Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/skihikingkevin/pubg-match-deaths)
   - **File**: `kill_match_stats_final_1.csv` (contains detailed player death locations).
   
2. **Data Cleaning**:
   - The raw dataset contained **1,048,575 rows** of data, including:
     - **Victim Position (x and y coordinates)** and the **map** where the death occurred.
     - **Issues**: Some data points had invalid coordinates (e.g., `0's` indicating players who did not have a death position).

3. **Data Processing**:
   - Cleaned the dataset by removing rows with invalid victim positions.
   - Imported the cleaned data into **Tableau** for visualization.

4. **Heatmap Creation**:
   - **Erangel Map**: ~800k data points
   - **Miramar Map**: ~180k data points
   - The **x and y axes** represent death locations on the 800 x 800 grid of the map.
   - Data points were converted into a **density plot** with a **gradient color scale** to show areas with higher or lower death rates.

5. **Customization**:
   - Adjusted **Opacity**, **Intensity**, and **Size** of the data points to highlight key areas with frequent deaths.
   - Overlaid **Erangel** and **Miramar** maps on the dashboard for context.

### **How to Use the Heatmaps**

1. **Visualize the Heatmaps**:
   - Open the heatmaps for **Erangel** and **Miramar** to analyze which areas of the map have the highest death rates.
   
2. **Use in Strategy & Analysis**:
   - Players can use these heatmaps to identify **high-risk zones** and modify their strategies accordingly (e.g., avoid frequent death spots).
   - Map shrinkage and spawn points (high density loot areas) are key factors that influence death location.

### **Requirements**

- **Tableau** for creating the heatmaps.
- **Data**: `kill_match_stats_final_1.csv` (available in the Kaggle dataset).

### **Forward Looking**
This project emerged from my playtests with _Arkheron_, which sparked a curiosity about players‚Äô game experience. Gaming has always intrigued me as a blend of imagination and reality, with a heavy emphasis on player experience, or the ‚Äúfeel‚Äù. I wanted to understand how game developers, whether with _Arkheron_ or _PUBG_, curate this experience. By exploring heatmaps and data visualizations, I gained insights into player behavior‚Äîwhere they spawn or die, where combat occurs, and how weapon placement affects it all. This data lends to crafting an immersive experience that feels organic, subtly guiding the player while maintaining the illusion of control. The ability to utilize data visualizations to enhance game experience excited me, and I am eager to continue exploring this aspect of game development.
